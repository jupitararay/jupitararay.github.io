### Vowel Space Area Variation in Assamese Dialects 
In this study, I explore the sociophonetic variation in the vowel space of Assamese, in order to provide an empirical account of language variation and change in a socioeconomic context. 

### A Phonological Description of Koch Rajbongshi
I am currently working on developing a phonological description of Koch Rajbongshi, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of northeast India and Bangladesh. 

### Infant Speech Babbling Patterns in Kabyle-Berber
I collaborated with my colleagues Dalila Gauoa and Jackson Kellog on a project where we studied the speech patterns of a Kabyle-Berber speaking infant, to understand if babbling patterns exhibited in children are truly universal.
