<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a third-year PhD student at Boston University and my research areas are phonetics and phonology. 

I have always found sounds produced by human speech most fascinating. And as a speaker of an under-documented language, I mostly work in describing the phonetics and phonology of under-described languages.
