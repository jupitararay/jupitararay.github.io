  I have worked on identifying variation in the vowel space of Assamese speakers by looking at socioeconomic factors. I am also currently trying to create a phonological description of my native language, Koch Rajbongshi, an under-represented language spoken in the Indian subcontinent. For this, I am collecting audio recordings from native Koch Rajbongshi speakers in Assam, India. If you are a native speaker, or know somebody who is, please send me an email!
