<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a third-year PhD student at Boston University and my research areas are mostly in phonetics and phonology. 

I have always found speech sounds most fascinating. And as a speaker of an under-studied language, I mostly work in describing the phonetics and phonology of under-described languages.
