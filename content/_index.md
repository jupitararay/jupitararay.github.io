subtitle: PhD candidate in Linguistics | she/her/hers  
description: নমস্কাৰ /nɔmɔskɑɹ/ (Assamese greeting)  <br>
  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Boston University. My research deals with bilingual speech, particularly in understanding how sequential 
  bilinguals phonetically accommodate in their L2 and the subsequent effects in the production and perception of their L1. 
  I am working under [Dr Charles Chang](https://cbchang.com/) as my first reader, with 
  [Dr Kate Lindsey](https://katelynnlindsey.weebly.com/) and 
  [Dr Esther de Leeuw](https://www.unil.ch/angl/en/home/menuinst/staff/english-linguistics/de-leeuw-esther.html/) 
  as my committee members.<br/> <br/>
