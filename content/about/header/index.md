I am a PhD candidate at Boston University and my research areas are mostly in phonetics and phonology. I received a Masters in Linguistics from EFL University India in 2019, where I also earned my Bachelors in English Language and Literature in 2017. 

I have always found speech sounds very fascinating. I am interested understanding how speakers with different L1s converge in their L2 speech while conversing with others. 

Outside of my research, I enjoy painting, spending time surrounded by nature, and anything Studio Ghibli.
