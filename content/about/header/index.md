I am a fourth-year PhD student at Boston University and my research areas are mostly in phonetics and phonology. I received a Masters in Linguistics from EFL University India in 2019, where I also earned my Bachelors in English Language and Literature in 2017. 

I have always found speech sounds very fascinating. And as a speaker of an under-studied language, I mostly work in describing the phonetics and phonology of under-described languages. 

Outside of my research, I enjoy painting (mostly watercolour), spending time surrounded by nature, cooking, and anything Studio Ghibli.
