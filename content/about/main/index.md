  My current research project is collecting judgement from speakers on control structures, particularly the backward and copy-control phenomenon in Assamese. I am also involved in analyzing data collected from a questionnaire about languages spoken in Daru, Papua New Guinea, with Dr Kate Lynn Lindsey. More recent works include identifying variation in the vowel space of Assamese speakers by looking at socioeconomic factors. I am also currently trying to create a phonological description of my native language, Koch Rajbongshi, an under-represented language spoken in the Indian subcontinent. For this, I am collecting audio recordings from native Koch Rajbongshi speakers in Assam, India. If you are a native speaker, or know somebody who is, please send me an email!
